        "error": "The angle of leg folding is unreasonable",
        "advice": "When performing sit-ups, improper leg bending can negatively affect the effectiveness of the exercise and potentially lead to injury. The following are some improvement suggestions to ensure a proper leg angle during sit-ups: \n\n1. **Correct Knee Angle**: When doing sit-ups, your knees should be bent at approximately 90° to support your lower back and reduce pressure on your spine. If the knee angle is too large (over 90°), it can reduce the intensity of the abdominal contraction. Conversely, if the angle is too small, it increases the stress on the lower back, potentially causing strain or injury. \n\n**Tip**: Aim to keep the knees at a 90° angle throughout the exercise for optimal performance and safety. \n\n2. **Avoid Knees Over the Toes**: Ensure that your feet are flat on the floor and that your knees do not extend beyond your toes. When the knees are excessively bent or misaligned, it can place unnecessary strain on the knee joints and increase the risk of injury. \n\n**Tip**: Keep the knees aligned with the feet, and avoid any inward or outward movement during the exercise. \n\n3. **Stable Leg Position**: If you feel instability in your legs or discomfort in your knees, consider using ankle straps or fixed equipment to secure your feet. This will help prevent your knees from rotating or shifting and will improve the overall stability of the movement. \n\n**Tip**: Engage your thigh muscles to maintain stability and support the pelvis and lower back during the exercise. \n\n4. **Mind the Lower Back**: Ensure that your lower back stays in contact with the floor while you perform the sit-up, especially during the upward phase. This will help maintain proper posture and reduce unnecessary strain on the spine. \n\n**Tip**: Press your lower back gently into the floor to stabilize the body and prevent excessive arching of the back, which can lead to injury. \n\nBy focusing on these points, you can optimize your sit-up technique, reduce injury risk, and improve the overall effectiveness of your workout."

    "shoulder_not_touch_with_cushion": {
        "error": "The shoulder blade is not touched the pad",
        "advice": "If the shoulder blades do not touch the mat during sit-ups, it suggests that the movement is not being performed fully, which can limit the activation of the core muscles and reduce the effectiveness of the exercise. Here are some improvement suggestions to ensure your shoulder blades make contact with the mat, thereby improving the exercise's effectiveness and safety: \n\n1. **Ensure Full Upper Body Curl**: When performing sit-ups, ensure your upper body curls fully until your shoulder blades completely lift off the ground. Simply raising your head and upper back does not effectively engage the abdominal muscles. The entire upper body should gradually curl, not just the head and neck. \n\n**Tip**: Focus on curling your shoulder blades off the mat during the sit-up. You can also place your hands on your shoulders or chest to help you sense the motion of your upper body. \n\n2. **Increase Range of Motion**: Many people fail to fully complete the motion due to weak core or back muscles, resulting in shoulder blades not making contact with the mat. To improve this, try performing deeper curls. \n\n**Tip**: During the sit-up, aim to curl forward as much as possible, ensuring your upper back is close to the mat, and eventually, the shoulder blades touch the ground. This will help activate the abdominal muscles more effectively. \n\n3. **Avoid Using Hands to Push the Neck or Head**: Avoid using your hands to push your neck or head during the sit-up, as this can lead to improper form, preventing the shoulder blades from lifting off the mat. \n\n**Tip**: Place your hands lightly on your ears or across your chest. Let your abdominal muscles control the movement, not your arms or hands. \n\n4. **Focus on Lower Back Stability**: If the lower back begins to arch or lift off the floor during the movement, it indicates improper form and can prevent the shoulder blades from properly touching the mat. \n\n**Tip**: Engage your lower back and keep your spine neutral throughout the movement. Ensure that your lower back remains in contact with the mat to provide the necessary stability. \n\n5. **Practice Controlled Motion**: Quick or jerky movements can prevent the shoulder blades from fully curling off the mat. Focus on slow and controlled movements to ensure proper form and muscle engagement. \n\n**Tip**: Perform sit-ups at a steady pace, emphasizing control and focusing on the abdominal muscles' contraction. \n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your sit-up technique, ensure full engagement of the core, and reduce strain on your back, thereby increasing both the effectiveness and safety of your workout."

    "elbows_not_touch_thighs": {
        "error": "The elbows did not touch the thighs",
        "advice": "If your elbows do not touch your thighs during sit-ups, it indicates that you may not be completing the full range of motion, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise and limits the engagement of your core muscles. Here are some improvement suggestions to ensure your elbows touch your thighs during sit-ups, maximizing the workout's benefits and reducing the risk of injury: \n\n1. **Full Upper Body Curl**: To ensure your elbows reach your thighs, you need to fully curl your upper body until your chest and ribs come toward your knees. Simply lifting your head and shoulders is not enough to activate your abdominal muscles fully. The entire upper body should be involved in the movement. \n\n**Tip**: Focus on curling your torso forward so that your elbows come into contact with your thighs. You should feel your core muscles contracting as you move upward. \n\n2. **Increase Range of Motion**: If you feel that your elbows are not reaching your thighs, it may be because you are not performing a full range of motion. To increase this range, try curling further forward. \n\n**Tip**: Perform sit-ups with a deeper curl, bringing your chest as close as possible to your thighs. This will allow your elbows to come in contact with your legs, fully engaging your core. \n\n3. **Avoid Neck or Head Assistance**: Many people use their hands or neck muscles to help lift their body, which can lead to improper form. This may cause your elbows to miss your thighs and reduce the effectiveness of the exercise. \n\n**Tip**: Keep your hands lightly placed on your ears or crossed over your chest. Let your core muscles drive the movement, and avoid pushing with your hands or straining your neck. \n\n4. **Engage Your Core Muscles**: The lack of shoulder and upper body engagement often results in the elbows failing to reach the thighs. A stronger engagement of your abdominal muscles can help lift the torso more effectively. \n\n**Tip**: Engage your abdominal muscles as soon as you begin the sit-up. Focus on using your core to lift your upper body rather than relying on momentum or your arms. \n\n5. **Focus on Control and Pace**: Performing sit-ups too quickly or with poor control can prevent your elbows from reaching your thighs. The goal is to execute the movement with precision, ensuring the full engagement of the abdominal muscles throughout the exercise. \n\n**Tip**: Perform sit-ups slowly and with control. Avoid jerky movements, and ensure your elbows come into contact with your thighs by maintaining a steady pace. \n\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that your elbows reach your thighs during sit-ups, maximizing the effectiveness of the exercise, improving core activation, and reducing the risk of injury."

        "error": "Lumbar rebound relay",
        "advice": "If you experience jerky or bouncing movements in your lower back during sit-ups, this indicates poor form and can lead to unnecessary strain on your spine and increase the risk of injury. Here are some improvement suggestions to prevent lower back jerking during sit-ups and ensure proper form: \n\n1. **Engage Your Core Muscles**: One of the main reasons for lower back jerking is the lack of core engagement. If your core muscles (abs, obliques) are not engaged, the lower back compensates, leading to jerking. \n\n**Tip**: Before starting the sit-up, tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. This will stabilize your pelvis and prevent your lower back from overcompensating. \n\n2. **Avoid Using Momentum**: Jerking motions often result from trying to complete sit-ups too quickly or using momentum to force your body up. This increases the risk of lower back strain. \n\n**Tip**: Perform sit-ups slowly and with control. Focus on the muscle contraction rather than using momentum to swing your body up. \n\n3. **Proper Lower Back Positioning**: The lower back should remain in contact with the floor throughout the exercise. If the lower back is lifting off the mat, you are likely arching it, which leads to jerking and strain. \n\n**Tip**: Make sure your lower back stays flat against the mat as you perform the sit-up. Engage your lower abdominal muscles to prevent excessive arching. \n\n4. **Use Proper Leg Positioning**: If your legs are not positioned correctly, your hips and pelvis may tilt during the movement, which can cause jerking in the lower back. \n\n**Tip**: Keep your knees bent at about 90 degrees and your feet flat on the floor. Ensure that your legs stay stable and do not slide or move excessively during the sit-up. \n\n5. **Strengthen Your Core Muscles**: Weak core muscles are a common cause of lower back jerking. Strengthening your abdominal, lower back, and hip muscles will help maintain proper alignment and stability during sit-ups. \n\n**Tip**: Include other core strengthening exercises such as planks and leg raises to build up the muscles needed for proper sit-up form. \n\nBy following these suggestions, you can avoid lower back jerking during sit-ups, improve your form, and reduce the risk of injury. Remember, core engagement, slow controlled movements, and proper posture are key to performing effective and safe sit-ups."

    "hold_head_with_hands": {
        "error": "Pull the head with both hands",
        "advice": "If you are pulling on your head during sit-ups, it can strain your neck and lower back, leading to poor form and potential injury. Here are some suggestions to avoid pulling on your head and ensure safer and more effective sit-ups: \n\n1. **Keep Hands Positioned Correctly**: Placing your hands behind your head or across your chest is crucial. Avoid pulling on your neck or head to assist with the movement. Using your hands to support your neck can lead to neck strain and improper form. \n\n**Tip**: Gently place your hands behind your ears or on your chest, keeping your elbows wide to prevent any neck strain. \n\n2. **Engage Your Core Muscles**: Relying on your arms or hands to pull your head up often means your core muscles aren't properly engaged. This can lead to inefficient use of your abdominal muscles, causing neck and back discomfort. \n\n**Tip**: Before starting the sit-up, brace your core by pulling your navel toward your spine. Use your abdominal muscles to curl your torso up, not your arms or neck. \n\n3. **Avoid Using Momentum**: Jerking your head or neck to complete the sit-up can lead to unnecessary strain. Quick or forceful movements often come from using momentum rather than muscle control. \n\n**Tip**: Perform sit-ups slowly and deliberately, focusing on contracting your core muscles. A controlled movement ensures you engage the right muscles and avoid strain. \n\n4. **Support Your Neck**: If you feel discomfort in your neck during sit-ups, your neck may not be properly supported. The goal is to engage your abdominal muscles, not strain your neck. \n\n**Tip**: Keep your neck in a neutral position, and avoid craning or forcing your head forward. You can also consider placing a small cushion under your head for added support. \n\n5. **Strengthen Your Core**: Weak core muscles can cause you to rely on your neck or arms for support, increasing the risk of injury. Strengthening your abs, obliques, and hip flexors will improve sit-up performance and reduce strain on the neck. \n\n**Tip**: Incorporate additional core exercises such as planks and leg raises into your workout to build strength in the muscles required for proper sit-up form. \n\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that your core is properly engaged, reduce strain on your neck, and perform sit-ups with better form and less risk of injury."
